# Design of a RISC-V Microprocessor

This repo contains the course material for the 3 weeks course at
DTU on designing a RISC-V microprocessor.

See the `Makefile` for the hardware and test targets.

## Rules

 * The processor shall implement the RISC-V RV32I instruction set.
 * The processor shall be pipelined.
 * The processor shall be able to run a simple program in an FPGA.
